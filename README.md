## What is [GeoCAT Applications](https://ncar.github.io/geocat-applications/)?

GeoCAT Applications is a community resource managed by the GeoCAT team. Inspired by the
[NCL Applications](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/).

GeoCAT Applications is broken into two main sections:
1. Applications
2. NCL to Python

### Applications
Applications is designed to be a quick reference to demonstrate capabilities within the Scientific
Python Ecosystem that may be relevant to your geoscience workflows

### NCL to Python
NCL to Python are pages that explain specifically how to achieve something that was possible in NCL
in Python, including any algorithmic differences, guidance regarding replication under different
conditions or circumstances, and any other relevant comparisons between the NCL and Python functionality

These pages assume that the user has a working knowledge of NCL and are looking for transitional
resources for specific functions. They also are not intended to be a comprehensive explanation of
the Python recommendations, but rather a guide for users who are already familiar with the NCL
function and are looking for “equivalent” Python code

NCL Index
=========
This page consists of notebooks that explain specifically how to achieve something that was possible
in NCL in Python, including any algorithmic differences, guidance regarding replication under different
conditions or circumstances, and any other relevant comparisons between the NCL and Python functionality.

This is part of the GeoCAT team's commitment to NCL and NSF NCAR's `Pivot to Python <https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Pivot_to_Python/>`_.

These notebooks assume that the user has a working knowledge of NCL and are looking for transitional
resources for specific functions. They also are not intended to be a comprehensive explanation of
the Python recommendations, but rather a guide for users who are already familiar with the NCL
function and are looking for “equivalent” Python code.

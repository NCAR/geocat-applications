    "Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) reprseents the largest subseasonal (30 to 90 day) atmospheric variability in the low latitude tropical atmosphere. MJO is an eastward traveling atmospheric pattern, moving between 4 to 8 m/s, which influences the location and strength of rainfall in the tropics\n",

    "Wheeler-Hendon is a phase plot and diagnostics tool ([Wheeler and Hendon, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2004)132%3C1917:AARMMI%3E2.0.CO;2)) to quantify the strength and significance of the MJO over time. The plot represents the Real-Time Multivariate MJO (RMM) which is made up of a pair of empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) from the combined equatorially averaged 850-hPa and 200-hPa zonal wind and the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outgoing Longwave Radiation: The longwave radiation emitted from the top of the Earth's atmosphere into space\n",
    "- Zonal wind: The zonal wind anomaly at 200-hPa and 850-hPa represents the changes in the atmospheric circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The pair of principal components from the EOFs form two indices: RMM1 and RMM2. The phase relationship between the two zonal winds determine the motion of the MJO\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMM1**: Represents the MJO's amplitude, where a larger RMM1 indicates stronger MJO activity. Negative values indicate a inactive or suppressed MJO phase and postive values indicate an active or enchanced MJO circulation\n",
    "- **RMM2**: Represents the MJO's phase, where the phase determines the geographic position of the MJO's convection center. It is split into eight phases, each linked to a specific equatorial region\n",

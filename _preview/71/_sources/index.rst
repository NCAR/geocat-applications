GeoCAT Applications
===================

GeoCAT Applications is a community resource managed by the GeoCAT team. Inspired by the
`NCL Applications <https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/>`_ page, this is designed to be a quick reference
demonstrating capabilities within the Scientific Python Ecosystem that may be relevant to your geoscience workflows.

GeoCAT Applications
===================

GeoCAT Applications is a community resource managed by the GeoCAT team. Inspired by the
`NCL Applications <https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/>`_ page, GeoCAT Applications is
designed to be a quick reference guide demonstrating capabilities within the scientific
Python ecosystem that may be relevant to your geoscience workflows.

# Computational Notebook Template
This template is designed to be the main page of content for a specific topic added to geocat-applications.

It should start with a header describing the type of functionality the notebook demonstrates and should be the only use of the top level header (`#`) in the notebook.


## Overview
When possible, lead with a short intro paragraph that covers the content and scope of the materials in the notebook


## Content Sections
In the content sections, provide sections on topics such as:
- working through a geoscience-specific problem
- explaining the concepts behind the functionality
- introducing other examples in the python ecosystem that cover similar topics

These may include some code blocks like this:

```python
# Python code
```

They may also include citations {footcite}`project_jupyter-proc-scipy-2018`, which can also be formatted as textual citations, {footcite:t}`project_jupyter-proc-scipy-2018`. Here's one more for good measure {footcite}`perez2011python,barba2019teaching,granger2021jupyter`. You can find more information [here in the MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/citations) as well.

*Note that these examples can be their own ##-level headers and that your final notebook is not expected to have a section with the ## Content Sections present in this cell*

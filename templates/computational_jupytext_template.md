# Computational Notebook Template
This template is designed to be the main page of content for a specific topic added to geocat-applications.

It should start with a header describing the type of functionality the notebook demonstrates and should be the only use of the top level header (`#`) in the notebook.


## Overview
When possible, lead with a short intro paragraph that covers the content and scope of the materials in the notebook

<!-- #region -->
## Grab and Go

Where possible, provide a code section that can be copied and pasted to use the base-level functionality described in the notebook.

```python
# Python code
```
<!-- #endregion -->

---


 ## Content Sections
In the content sections, provide sections on topics such as:
- working through a geoscience-specific problem
- explaining the concepts behind the functionality
- introducing other examples in the python ecosystem that cover similar topics

Here's an example citation {footcite}`project_jupyter-proc-scipy-2018`.

And another one with a textual citation, {footcite:t}`project_jupyter-proc-scipy-2018`.

And a few more for good measure {footcite}`perez2011python,barba2019teaching,granger2021jupyter`.

*Note that these examples can be their own ##-level headers and that your final notebook is not expected to have a section with the ## Content Sections present in this cell*
